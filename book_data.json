        "bio": "The Queen of Mystery has come to Harper Collins! Agatha Christie, the acknowledged mistress of suspense\u2014creator of indomitable sleuth Miss Marple, meticulous Belgian detective Hercule Poirot, and so many other unforgettable characters\u2014brings her entire oeuvre of ingenious whodunits, locked room mysteries, and perplexing puzzles to Harper Paperbacks\u2026including Murder on the Orient Express, the most famous Hercule Poirot mystery, which has the brilliant detective hunting for a killer aboard one of the world\u2019s most luxurious passenger trains.",
        "description": "After taking the Taurus Express from Aleppo in Syria to Istanbul, private detective Hercule Poirot arrives at the Tokatlian Hotel. There he receives a telegram prompting him to return to London. He instructs the concierge to book him a first-class compartment on the Simplon-route Orient Express service leaving that night. Although the train is fully booked, Poirot obtains a second-class berth, but only with the intervention of a friend and fellow Belgian who is also boarding the train, Monsieur Bouc, a director of the railway, Compagnie Internationale des Wagons-Lits.\r\n\r\nA brash and vulgar American businessman named Ratchett is aboard the train with his personal secretary and translator, Hector McQueen. Once Poirot is recognised as the famous detective, Ratchett approaches him and asks if he will act as his protector as Ratchett has been receiving death threats. Poirot, repulsed by Mr. Ratchett, refuses the case. M Bouc has taken the last first-class cabin, but arranges to be moved to a separate coach and gives Poirot his space in first class. The first night Poirot sleeps in first class, he observes some strange occurrences. Early in the morning, Poirot is wakened by a cry from Ratchett's compartment next to him. The Wagons-Lits conductor knocks on Ratchett's door and a voice from inside responds, \"Ce n'est rien. Je me suis tromp\u00e9\" (It is nothing. I am mistaken). Poirot has difficulty sleeping because there is a peculiar silence on the train. Mrs Hubbard rings her bell and tells the conductor a man is in her room. Poirot rings his bell for water and is informed by the conductor that the train is stuck in a snowbank. Poirot hears a loud thump next door.\r\n\r\nThe next morning, the train still stopped, M Bouc informs Poirot that Ratchett has been murdered and the murderer is still aboard the train. Poirot tells M Bouc he will investigate the case. Poirot first examines Ratchett's body and compartment. Ratchett has 12 stab wounds. The window had been left open in Ratchett's compartment, presumably to make the investigators think the murderer escaped out the window, but there are no footprints outside the window in the snow. A handkerchief with the initial 'H' is found in the compartment, a pipe cleaner, a round match different from the matches Ratchett used and a charred piece of paper with the name 'Armstrong' on it.\r\n\r\nThis piece of paper helps Poirot to work out who Ratchett really is and why someone would want to murder him. A few years earlier, a man named Cassetti kidnapped a three-year-old, Daisy Armstrong. Cassetti collected a ransom from the wealthy Armstrong family, but killed the child within two hours of kidnapping her. Poirot concludes that 'Ratchett' was actually Cassetti. The voice in Ratchett's compartment could not have been the American's, since Ratchett/Cassetti spoke no French.\r\n\r\nThe interviews start with the Wagons-Lits conductor, then Hector McQueen. Poirot knows that McQueen is involved with the case because he knows about the Armstrong note found in Ratchett's compartment. Hector is surprised that Poirot found the note because he thought it had been destroyed. Poirot then interviews Masterman and then Mrs Hubbard, who claims that the murderer was in her cabin. All of the passengers give Poirot suitable alibis during their interviews, although a few suspicious elements are brought to light: many passengers observed a woman in a red kimono walking down the hallway on the night of the murder, but no one admits they have a red kimono. Mrs Hubbard tells Poirot she had Greta Ohlsson lock the communicating door between her compartment and Ratchett's. Hildegarde Schmidt bumped into a stranger wearing a Wagons-Lits uniform blazer.\r\n\r\nPoirot checks every passenger's luggage. During the check he is surprised by several things: the label on Countess Andrenyi's luggage is wet, a Wagons-Lits uniform is found in Hildegarde Schmidt's bag and the red kimono is found in Poirot's own luggage.\r\n\r\nAfter the luggage check, Poirot, Dr Constantine and M Bouc review the facts of the case and develop a list of questions. With the evidence and questions in mind, Poirot sits and thinks about the case. When he surfaces from a trance-like state, Poirot has realised the solution to the case. He calls in several people and reveals their true identities. All of them were connected with the Armstrong tragedy in some way. Poirot discovers Countess Andrenyi is Helena Goldenberg, aunt of Daisy Armstrong. She smudged her luggage label and obscured her name, in an effort to conceal her identity. Mary Debenham was Daisy's governess; Antonio Foscanelli was the Armstrongs' chauffeur; Masterman was Col Armstrong's valet; and Greta Ohlsson was Daisy Armstrong's nurse. Princess Dragomiroff, revealed to be Sonia Armstrong's godmother, claims the monogrammed handkerchief found in Ratchett's compartment.\r\n\r\nPoirot gathers all of the passengers into the dining car and propounds two possible solutions. The first solution is that a stranger entered the train when it stopped at Vinkovci, killed Ratchett and disembarked from the train. The second solution is that the passengers aboard the Orient Express participated in stabbing Cassetti/Ratchett to death. Poirot suggests that 12 of the 13 passengers, all close to the Armstrong case, killed Ratchett to avenge the murder of Daisy Armstrong. Mrs Hubbard, revealed as the famous actress Linda Arden, admits that the second solution is correct.\r\n\r\nPoirot suggests that M Bouc and Dr Constantine tell the police that the first solution is correct to protect the family. M Bouc and Dr Constantine accept Poirot's suggestion.",

        "bio": "Raymond Thornton Chandler (July 23, 1888 \u2013 March 26, 1959) was an American-British novelist and screenwriter. In 1932, at the age of forty-four, Chandler became a detective fiction writer after losing his job as an oil company executive during the Great Depression. His first short story, \"Blackmailers Don't Shoot\", was published in 1933 in Black Mask, a popular pulp magazine. His first novel, The Big Sleep, was published in 1939. In addition to his short stories, Chandler published seven novels during his lifetime (an eighth, in progress at the time of his death, was completed by Robert B. Parker). All but Playback have been made into motion pictures, some more than once. In the year before his death, he was elected president of the Mystery Writers of America.\r\n\r\nChandler had an immense stylistic influence on American popular literature. He is considered to be a founder of the hard-boiled school of detective fiction, along with Dashiell Hammett, James M. Cain and other Black Mask writers. The protagonist of his novels, Philip Marlowe, like Hammett's Sam Spade, is considered by some to be synonymous with \"private detective\". Both were played in films by Humphrey Bogart, whom many consider to be the quintessential Marlowe.",
        "description": "In Raymond Chandler's The Big Sleep, private investigator Philip Marlowe goes to the wealthy General Sternwood's home on a job. Sternwood is being blackmailed by the local bookseller, Arthur Geiger, because of his partying daughter Carmen, and Sternwood wants Marlowe to make the problem go away. Sternwood also mentions that his older daughter, Vivian, has a husband named Rusty Regan, who has disappeared.\r\n\r\nWhen Marlowe visits Geiger's bookstore, he quickly figures out that it's a front for a pornography racket. He goes to Geiger's house, only to find Geiger shot dead and a half-naked Carmen too drugged to know up from down. The next day, Sternwood's chauffeur, Owen Taylor, turns up dead.\r\n\r\nVivian visits Marlowe and tells him that her family is now being blackmailed over pornographic photos of Carmen. Marlowe traces Geiger's pornographic collection and Carmen's naked photos to a man named Joe Brody. While he's confronting Brody and Brody's girlfriend, Agnes, Carmen bursts in with a gun. Marlowe disarms her.\r\n\r\nMarlowe gets the photos from Brody and continues to question him. It comes out that the chauffeur killed Geiger over Carmen's nude photos. Brody admits that he attacked the chauffeur and took the photos of Carmen, but he denies murdering anyone. Geiger's lover, a man named Carol Lundgren, suddenly shows up and shoots Brody, mistakenly thinking that Brody was Geiger's murderer.\r\n\r\nWith the photos of Carmen recovered, Marlowe's job for General Sternwood is finished. But Marlowe is still bugged by the disappearance of Rusty Regan. There's a rumor that Regan ran off with Mona Mars, the wife of gambling kingpin Eddie Mars, but Marlowe doesn't buy it. That night, Carmen shows up at his apartment and tries to seduce him. He throws her out.\r\n\r\nWith Brody dead, Agnes gets a new partner named Harry Jones, who offers to sell Marlowe the name of the place where Mona Mars is hiding. Eddie Mars' hired gunman Canino kills Jones, but Marlowe manages to get the information from Agnes anyway. When Marlowe checks out the place - an auto repair shop - he gets jumped and knocked out. He awakens to find himself tied up. Mona Mars is there. She tells him that she didn't run off with Regan and is only hiding to help her husband. Then she unties Marlowe and helps him escape. During the escape, Marlowe kills Canino.\r\n\r\nMarlowe visits General Sternwood the next day. He gives Carmen back her gun, and she tries to shoot him for turning down her advances. He disarms her and confirms that Carmen is the one who killed Regan after he also refused to sleep with her. Eddie Mars and Vivian had tried to protect Carmen by hiding the body and making up the rumor that Regan ran off with Mona Mars. Vivian promises Marlowe that Carmen will be sent to get proper help.",

The diner is operated by a beautiful young woman, Cora, and her much older husband, Nick Papadakis, sometimes called \"the Greek\".\r\n\r\nFrank and Cora feel an immediate attraction to each other and begin a passionate affair with sadomasochistic qualities (when they first embrace, Cora commands Frank to bite her lip, and Frank does so hard enough to draw blood).\r\n\r\nCora is tired of her situation, married to a man she does not love and working at a diner that she wants to own and improve. Frank and Cora scheme to murder the Greek in order to start a new life together without Cora losing the diner.\r\n\r\nThey plan on striking Nick's head and making it seem he fell and drowned in the bathtub. Cora fells Nick with a solid blow, but a sudden power outage and the appearance of a policeman make the scheme fail. Nick recovers and because of retrograde amnesia does not suspect that he narrowly avoided being killed.\r\n\r\nDetermined to kill Nick, Frank and Cora fake a car accident. They ply Nick with wine, strike him on the head, and crash the car. Frank and Cora are injured. The local prosecutor suspects what has actually occurred but does not have enough evidence to prove it. As a tactic intended to get Cora and Frank to turn on each other, he charges only Cora with the crime of Nick's murder, coercing Frank to sign a complaint against her.\r\n\r\nCora, furious and indignant, insists on offering a full confession detailing both their roles. Her lawyer tricks her into dictating that confession to a member of his own staff. Cora, believing her confession made, returns to prison. Though Cora would be sure to learn of the trickery, a few valuable hours are gained. The lawyer uses the time to manipulate those financially interested in the trial to have their private detective recant his testimony, which was the final remaining weapon in the prosecution's arsenal. The state is forced to grant Cora a plea agreement under which she is given a suspended sentence and no jail time.\r\n\r\nFrank and Cora patch things up and plan a happy future and a family. Then Cora is killed in a car crash while Frank is driving. The book ends with Frank, from death row, summarizing the events that followed, explaining that he was wrongly convicted of having murdered Cora. The text, he hopes, will be published after his execution.",

        "description": "In December 2002, Mikael Blomkvist, publisher of the Swedish political magazine Millennium, loses a libel case involving allegations about billionaire industrialist Hans-Erik Wennerstr\u00f6m. Blomkvist is sentenced to three months (deferred) in prison, and ordered to pay hefty damages and costs. Soon afterwards, he is invited to meet Henrik Vanger, the retired CEO of the Vanger Corporation, unaware that Vanger has checked into his personal and professional history; the investigation of Blomkvist's circumstances has been carried out by Lisbeth Salander, a brilliant but deeply troubled researcher and computer hacker.\r\n\r\nVanger promises to provide Blomkvist with evidence against Wennerstr\u00f6m in return for discovering what happened to Vanger's grandniece, Harriet, who disappeared in 1966 during a family gathering at the Vanger estate on Hedeby Island the same day that a traffic accident on a bridge temporarily cut off the island from the mainland. Blomkvist stays on the island while researching the Vanger family history and Harriet's disappearance. He meets several members of the Vanger clan, including Harriet's brother, Martin, current CEO of the company; Isabella, Martin and Harriet's mother; and Cecilia, a headmistress who was Harriet's younger aunt and friend, who seduces Blomkvist later in the novel.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Salander's state-appointed legal guardian Holger Palmgren suffers a stroke. He is replaced by Nils Bjurman, who extorts sexual acts from Salander and eventually rapes her. After secretly recording her assault, Salander takes her revenge, torturing Bjurman and threatening to ruin him unless he gives her full control over her life and finances. She then uses a tattoo machine to brand him as a rapist.\r\n\r\nOn Hedeby Island, Blomkvist pursues new evidence in Harriet's disappearance, including photographs showing Harriet's discomfort at seeing an unidentified young man. He also discovers a set of names and numbers believed to be old telephone numbers in Harriet's journal; however, his daughter Pernilla identifies them as quotes from the Book of Leviticus, which describe rules about violent punishment of women. Blomkvist correlates one of them with the grotesque murder of a Vanger Corporation secretary in 1949, and realizes that he may be on the trail of an old serial killer. Vanger's lawyer suggests Salander as a research assistant.\r\n\r\nBlomkvist realises that Salander hacked into his computer for the initial report, and confronts her to ask her for help with the investigation, to which she agrees. The two eventually become casual lovers. Meanwhile, Salander uncovers the remaining four murders corresponding to the Bible quotes in Harriet's journal, as well as several more that fit the profile. However, they realize this is more than just an old cold case when a local cat is left dismembered on their porch, and Blomkvist is shot at from a distance during an afternoon jog.\r\n\r\nConvinced that there must be a connection between the murders and the Vanger family, Salander searches through the Vanger Corporation archives. She notices that most of the murders occurred in locations where the corporation did business. She begins to suspect that the murderer was Gottfried Vanger, Martin and Harriet's deceased father, but she finds out that he died prior to the last murder.\r\n\r\nWhile Salander continues to hunt through the archives, Blomkvist manages to identify the young man in the photograph: Harriet's brother Martin. However, before he can do anything, Martin takes Blomkvist prisoner, revealing that Gottfried \"initiated\" him into the ritual rape and murder of women before his own death, and implies that Gottfried sexually abused both him and Harriet. Martin admits to murdering dozens of women but denies killing his sister. He attempts to kill Blomkvist, but Salander \u2014 who had made the connection with Martin independently \u2014 arrives and attacks Martin. Martin flees by car, pursued by Salander, and commits suicide by purposely colliding with an oncoming truck.\r\n\r\nBelieving that Cecilia's sister Anita, who now lives in London, is the only relative who might know something about Harriet's fate, Blomkvist and Salander tap her phone and learn that Harriet is still alive and living under Anita's name in Australia. When Blomkvist flies there to meet her, Harriet tells him the truth about her disappearance: her father Gottfried had repeatedly raped her, until she killed him in self-defense. That did not solve the problem however, as Martin took his father's role and continued to rape her. Harriet found some peace when Martin was sent away to preparatory school, but he returned the day of her disappearance. Harriet realized she would never be free of him unless she ran away, so she found a place to hide during the traffic accident, and Anita smuggled her to the mainland the next morning. Blomkvist persuades Harriet to return to Sweden, where she reunites with Henrik. Blomkvist then accompanies Salander to her mother's funeral.\r\n\r\nBack in Sweden, Blomkvist learns that the evidence against Wennerstr\u00f6m that Vanger promised him is useless. However, Salander hacked Wennerstr\u00f6m's computer and discovered that his crimes went far beyond what Blomkvist documented. Using her evidence, Blomkvist prints an expos\u00e9 and a book which ruin Wennerstr\u00f6m and catapult Millennium to national prominence. Salander, using her hacking skills, succeeds in stealing some 2.6 billion kr (about $260 million USD) from Wennerstr\u00f6m's secret bank account. Blomkvist and Salander spend Christmas together in his holiday retreat. Shortly after, she goes to Blomkvist's home, intending to declare her love for him and give him a Christmas present, but when she sees him with his long-time lover and business partner Erika Berger, she throws the present in a dumpster and leaves.\r\n\r\nAs a postscript, Salander continues to monitor Wennerstr\u00f6m and after six months, anonymously informs a lawyer in Miami of his whereabouts. Four days later the body of Wennerstr\u00f6m is found in Marbella, Spain, shot three times in the head.",

She'd always have fancy dresses, a beautiful home filled with servants, and Mama, Papa, and Abuelita to care for her. But a sudden tragedy forces Esperanza and Mama to flee to California and settle in a Mexican farm labor camp. Esperanza isn't ready for the hard work, financial struggles brought on by the Great Depression, or lack of acceptance she now faces.

        "author": "Jane Yolen",
        "bio": "Born and raised in New York City, Jane Yolen now lives in Hatfield, Massachusetts. She attended Smith College and received her master's degree in education from the University of Massachusetts. The distinguished author of more than 170 books, Jane Yolen is a person of many talents. When she is not writing, Yolen composes songs, is a professional storyteller on the stage, and is the busy wife of a university professor, the mother of three grown children, and a grandmother.\r\n\r\nActive in several organizations, Yolen has been on the Board of Directors of the Society of Children's Book Writers and Illustrators, was president of the Science Fiction Writers of America from 1986 to 1988, is on the editorial board of several magazines, and was a founding member of the Western New England Storytellers Guild, the Western Massachusetts Illustrators Guild, and the Bay State Writers Guild. For twenty years, she ran a monthly writer's workshop for new children's book authors. In 1980, when Yolen was awarded an honorary Doctor of Law degree by Our Lady of the Elms College in Chicopee, Massachusetts, the citation recognized that \"throughout her writing career she has remained true to her primary source of inspiration--folk culture.\" Folklore is the \"perfect second skin,\" writes Yolen. \"From under its hide, we can see all the shimmering, shadowy uncertainties of the world.\" Folklore, she believes, is the universal human language, a language that children instinctively feel in their hearts.\r\n\r\nAll of Yolen's stories and poems are somehow rooted in her sense of family and self. The Emperor and the Kite, which was a Caldecott Honor Book in 1983 for its intricate papercut illustrations by Ed Young, was based on Yolen's relationship with her late father, who was an international kite-flying champion. Owl Moon, winner of the 1988 Caldecott Medal for John Schoenherr's exquisite watercolors, was inspired by her husband's interest in birding.\r\n\r\nYolen's graceful rhythms and outrageous rhymes have been gathered in numerous collections. She has earned many awards over the years: the Regina Medal, the Kerlan Award, the World Fantasy Award, the Society of Children's Book Writers Award, the Mythopoetic Society's Aslan Award, the Christopher Medal, the Boy's Club Jr. Book Award, the Garden State Children's Book Award, the Daedalus Award, a number of Parents' Choice Magazine Awards, and many more. Her books and stories have been translated into Japanese, French, Spanish, Chinese, German, Swedish, Norwegian, Danish, Afrikaans, !Xhosa, Portuguese, and Braille.\r\n\r\nWith a versatility that has led her to be called \"America's Hans Christian Andersen,\" Yolen, the child of two writers, is a gifted and natural storyteller. Perhaps the best explanation for her outstanding accomplishments comes from Jane Yolen herself: \"I don't care whether the story is real or fantastical. I tell the story that needs to be told.\"",
        "description": "Late one winter night a little girl and her father go owling. The trees stand still as statues and the world is silent as a dream. Whoo-whoo-whoo, the father calls to the mysterious nighttime bird.\r\n\r\nBut there is no answer.\r\n\r\nWordlessly the two companions walk along, for when you go owling you don't need words. You don't need anything but hope. Sometimes there isn't an owl, but sometimes there is.\r\n\r\nDistinguished author Jane Yolen has created a gentle, poetic story that lovingly depicts the special companionship of a young child and her father as well as humankind's close relationship to the natural world. Wonderfully complemented by John Schoenherr's soft, exquisite watercolor illustrations, this is a verbal and visual treasure, perfect for reading around and sharing at bedtime.",

        "bio": "William Butler Yeats (/\u02c8je\u026ats/; 13 June 1865 \u2013 28 January 1939) was an Irish poet and one of the foremost figures of 20th-century literature. A pillar of both the Irish and British literary establishments, in his later years he served as an Irish Senator for two terms. Yeats was a driving force behind the Irish Literary Revival and, along with Lady Gregory, Edward Martyn, and others, founded the Abbey Theatre, where he served as its chief during its early years. In 1923, he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature as the first Irishman so honoured for what the Nobel Committee described as \"inspired poetry, which in a highly artistic form gives expression to the spirit of a whole nation.\" Yeats is generally considered one of the few writers who completed their greatest works after being awarded the Nobel Prize; such works include The Tower (1928) and The Winding Stair and Other Poems (1929).\r\n\r\nWilliam Butler Yeats was born in Sandymount, Ireland and educated there and in London; he spent his childhood holidays in County Sligo. He studied poetry in his youth and from an early age was fascinated by both Irish legends and the occult. Those topics feature in the first phase of his work, which lasted roughly until the turn of the 20th century. His earliest volume of verse was published in 1889, and its slow-paced and lyrical poems display Yeats's debts to Edmund Spenser, Percy Bysshe Shelley, and the poets of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood. From 1900, Yeats's poetry grew more physical and realistic. He largely renounced the transcendental beliefs of his youth, though he remained preoccupied with physical and spiritual masks, as well as with cyclical theories of life.",
        "description": "One of Ireland's greatest writers, the Nobel-prize winner W. B. Yeats, was fascinated by the myths and folklore of his native country. Compiled by Yeats in 1892, these stories were collected around the country by a variety of historians, including Lady Wilde, the mother of Oscar Wilde.\r\n\r\nWithin these pages, you'll discover tales of greedy sons who get their comeuppance, canny priests, evil witches and demons alongside legends of heroic kings, giants and, of course, the good folk themselves - the fairies, the leprechauns and the cluricauns. These are yarns that have passed down through generations and which are still as entertaining and magical as when they were first recalled.\r\n\r\nThis gorgeous foil-stamped edition includes enchanting illustrations and is presented in a handsome slipcase.",

        "bio": "Born and raised in New York City, Jane Yolen now lives in Hatfield, Massachusetts. She attended Smith College and received her master's degree in education from the University of Massachusetts. The distinguished author of more than 170 books, Jane Yolen is a person of many talents. When she is not writing, Yolen composes songs, is a professional storyteller on the stage, and is the busy wife of a university professor, the mother of three grown children, and a grandmother. Active in several organizations, Yolen has been on the Board of Directors of the Society of Children's Book Writers and Illustrators, was president of the Science Fiction Writers of America from 1986 to 1988, is on the editorial board of several magazines, and was a founding member of the Western New England Storytellers Guild, the Western Massachusetts Illustrators Guild, and the Bay State Writers Guild. For twenty years, she ran a monthly writer's workshop for new children's book authors. In 1980, when Yolen was awarded an honorary Doctor of Law degree by Our Lady of the Elms College in Chicopee, Massachusetts, the citation recognized that \"throughout her writing career she has remained true to her primary source of inspiration--folk culture.\" Folklore is the \"perfect second skin,\" writes Yolen. \"From under its hide, we can see all the shimmering, shadowy uncertainties of the world.\" Folklore, she believes, is the universal human language, a language that children instinctively feel in their hearts. All of Yolen's stories and poems are somehow rooted in her sense of family and self. The Emperor and the Kite, which was a Caldecott Honor Book in 1983 for its intricate papercut illustrations by Ed Young, was based on Yolen's relationship with her late father, who was an international kite-flying champion. Owl Moon, winner of the 1988 Caldecott Medal for John Schoenherr's exquisite watercolors, was inspired by her husband's interest in birding. Yolen's graceful rhythms and outrageous rhymes have been gathered in numerous collections. She has earned many awards over the years: the Regina Medal, the Kerlan Award, the World Fantasy Award, the Society of Children's Book Writers Award, the Mythopoetic Society's Aslan Award, the Christopher Medal, the Boy's Club Jr. Book Award, the Garden State Children's Book Award, the Daedalus Award, a number of Parents' Choice Magazine Awards, and many more. Her books and stories have been translated into Japanese, French, Spanish, Chinese, German, Swedish, Norwegian, Danish, Afrikaans, !Xhosa, Portuguese, and Braille. With a versatility that has led her to be called \"America's Hans Christian Andersen,\" Yolen, the child of two writers, is a gifted and natural storyteller. Perhaps the best explanation for her outstanding accomplishments comes from Jane Yolen herself: \"I don't care whether the story is real or fantastical. I tell the story that needs to be told.\"",

        "description": "Neil Gaiman, long inspired by ancient mythology in creating the fantastical realms of his fiction, presents a bravura rendition of the Norse gods and their world from their origin though their upheaval in Ragnarok.\r\n\r\nIn Norse Mythology, Gaiman stays true to the myths in envisioning the major Norse pantheon: Odin, the highest of the high, wise, daring, and cunning; Thor, Odin\u2019s son, incredibly strong yet not the wisest of gods; and Loki\u2015son of a giant\u2015blood brother to Odin and a trickster and unsurpassable manipulator.\r\n\r\nGaiman fashions these primeval stories into a novelistic arc that begins with the genesis of the legendary nine worlds and delves into the exploits of deities, dwarfs, and giants. Through Gaiman\u2019s deft and witty prose, these gods emerge with their fiercely competitive natures, their susceptibility to being duped and to duping others, and their tendency to let passion ignite their actions, making these long-ago myths breathe pungent life again.",

But despite their dominance, and their rosters of superstar players, they have endured striking inequality: low pay, poor playing conditions, and limited opportunities to play in professional leagues. The National Team, from leading soccer journalist Caitlin Murray, tells the history of the USWNT in full, from their formation in the 1980s to the run-up to the 2019 World Cup, chronicling both their athletic triumphs and less visible challenges off the pitch. Murray also recounts the rise and fall of U.S. professional leagues, including the burgeoning National Womens Soccer League, an essential part of the womens game. Through nearly 100 exclusive interviews with players, coaches, and team officials, including Alex Morgan, Carli Lloyd, Hope Solo, Heather OReilly, Julie Foudy, Brandi Chastain, Pia Sundhage, Tom Sermanni, and Sunil Gulati, Murray takes readers inside the locker rooms and board rooms in engrossing detail.

        "description": "The Handmaid\u2019s Tale is a novel of such power that the reader will be unable to forget its images and its forecast. Set in the near future, it describes life in what was once the United States and is now called the Republic of Gilead, a monotheocracy that has reacted to social unrest and a sharply declining birthrate by reverting to, and going beyond, the repressive intolerance of the original Puritans. The regime takes the Book of Genesis absolutely at its word, with bizarre consequences for the women and men in its population.\r\n\r\nThe story is told through the eyes of Offred, one of the unfortunate Handmaids under the new social order. In condensed but eloquent prose, by turns cool-eyed, tender, despairing, passionate, and wry, she reveals to us the dark corners behind the establishment\u2019s calm facade, as certain tendencies now in existence are carried to their logical conclusions. The Handmaid\u2019s Tale is funny, unexpected, horrifying, and altogether convincing. It is at once scathing satire, dire warning, and a tour de force. It is Margaret Atwood at her best.",

He went on to write the screenplay for Tim Burton's Beetlejuice (1988) and The Nightmare Before Christmas (1993), as well as the script for Thinner (1996). McDowell died December 27, 1999 from AIDS-related illness. Tabitha King, wife of author Stephen King, completed an unfinished McDowell novel, Candles Burning, which was published in 2006.",

But her beautiful exterior hides a shocking secret. Beneath the waters of the Perdido River, she turns into something terrifying, a creature whispered about in stories that have chilled the residents of Perdido for generations. Some of those who observe her rituals in the river will never be seen again ...\r\n\r\nOriginally published as a series of six volumes in 1983, Blackwater is the crowning achievement of Michael McDowell, author of the Southern Gothic classics Cold Moon Over Babylon and The Elementals and screenwriter of Beetlejuice and The Nightmare Before Christmas. This first-ever one-volume edition, with a new introduction by Shirley Jackson Award-winning author Nathan Ballingrud, marks Blackwater\u2019s first appearance in print in three decades and will allow a new generation of readers to discover this modern horror classic.",
